The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**

The build failure is due to the command `vite build` not being found during the build process.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the Vite package is installed in the project and available in the build environment. 

1. Verify that Vite is listed as a dependency in the `package.json` file in your repository.
2. If Vite is missing, you should install it by running the following command in your project directory:
   ```bash
   npm install vite
   ```
3. After adding Vite as a dependency, commit the changes to your repository and trigger a new build on Netlify to see if the issue is resolved.
