The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to a configuration error stating that the deploy directory 'client/dist/public' does not exist.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `client/dist/public` directory exists in the repository.
2. If the directory is missing, create it or adjust the publish path to reflect the correct directory structure based on where the build artifacts are generated.
3. Make sure the correct paths are configured in the build settings to target the actual build output directory.
